4. Data Sharing
4.1 Third-Party Agents:
We reserve the right to engage third-party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and collaborative

obligations to maintain the confidentiality and security of data. Access to user data is limited
to what is essential for providing critical services associated with our applications.
4.2 Emergency Scenarios:
In exceptional circumstances, we may find it necessary to disclose your personal information

protection of our rights, property, safety, or the well-being of our user community.
4.3 Referral Program:
If you participate in our referral program, we may share the names and email addresses of
your referrals solely for the purpose of sending one-time invitations as part of the program
through email or other digital communication platforms.

5. Security Measures
We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect your personal information
during data transmission. However, it is essential to acknowledge that no method of data
transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as 100% secure. Therefore, we
recommend using our Services with awareness of this inherent limitation.

6. Data Transfer
By using our Services, you explicitly consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your
data in India or other countries where Rhyno or its affiliates operate. We exercise due
diligence to protect the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information during data
transfer, storage, and processing.
            
7. Links to Third-Party Applications
It is crucial to note that our Policy exclusively governs data collected by Rhyno. We
expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices and data
management procedures associated with third-party applications that may be accessed or
linked through our Services.
            
8. Changes to this Policy
In alignment with the evolution and refinement of our Services, we reserve the right to
periodically update and amend this Policy to accurately reflect changes in our data
management practices. Any such modifications will be publicly disclosed on our platforms. It
is your responsibility as a user to routinely review this Policy to remain informed about how
we collect, use, and protect your data.
            
9. Your Options and Opt-Out
You, as a user, retain the inherent right to modify and customise your communication
preferences within the bounds of your account profile. While the omission of certain data
may be exercised as a discretionary choice, it is incumbent upon users to recognize that
such action may result in limitations or restrictions on access to specific features and
functionalities.
            
10. Contact Information
For questions, concerns, or clarifications regarding this Policy, we encourage users to
contact us via email at info@rhyno.in
            
11. Legal Compliance
Our Services are rooted in the jurisdiction of India, and as such, we steadfastly adhere to all
relevant local data protection laws and consumer rights regulations. Users located outside
India are strongly encouraged to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the compatibility
of our privacy practices with the prevailing regional privacy laws in their respective
jurisdictions before providing any personal information to Rhyno.
            
12. Assignment
In the hypothetical scenario of corporate transformations or asset transfers, we retain the
discretion to transmit your data to a Rhyno entity that assumes ownership of our assets or
engages in a merger with our corporate structure. We expect such entities to endorse and
adhere to the principles outlined in this privacy statement.
            
13. Opt-Out Possibilities
While it may not be feasible to completely eliminate data collection during the use of our
Applications, users maintain the capacity to limit the extent to which their personally
identifiable information is collected, used, and shared. It is crucial to underscore that all
disclosures of personally identifiable information are undertaken voluntarily. However, users
must exercise due diligence in recognizing that the voluntary omission of certain information
may inadvertently impede or restrict access to specific features and functionalities.
            
14. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
We actively employ cookies and employ other tracking technologies for multifarious
purposes, including but not limited to user identification, analytics, and advertising. User
preferences with regard to cookies can be managed within browser settings. It is important
